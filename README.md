# Just another React + Tailwind boilerplate

A basic and opinionated boilerplate.

I'm probably going to add support for typescript soon.

## Why in the world should I use this rather than create-react-app?

I'm glad you asked! There's plenty of technical reasons but the main one is that CRA is bloated and full of stuff you'll never use (like sass dependencies).

[Here](https://github.com/Nikhil-Kumaran/ejected-react-app/blob/master/package.json) you can find a list of all the dependencies that you're installing under the hood while using CRA.

Furthermore, if you have a decent connection it takes less than 10 seconds to install all my boilerplate dependencies and you'll be ready to go!

## Is this actively maintained? 

Yes, I'm always working on a react project, every time I find something usefull I add it to the boilerplate to make it even better.

## Why should I use this boilerplate and not an other non-CRA boilerplate?

I don't really have a good argument for this one, feel free to use the one that suits best your needs!
